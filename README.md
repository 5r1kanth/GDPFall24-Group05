## Video Player Features

### 1. Speed Control
- **Purpose**: Allows users to watch videos at different speeds, such as slowing down for better understanding or speeding up to save time.
- **Common Use**: Used in educational videos, tutorials, and entertainment.
- **Range**: Typically from 0.5x (half speed) to 2x (double speed).
- **Considerations**: Adjusting playback speed should maintain synchronization between video and audio. Audio should not sound distorted, even at faster or slower speeds.

### 2. Subtitles
- **Purpose**: Display text captions during a video, which can represent spoken dialogue or describe sounds. Important for accessibility and supporting multiple languages.
- **Formats**: Common subtitle formats include WebVTT and SRT.
- **Usage**: Subtitles help users who are deaf, hard-of-hearing, or watching in a non-native language. Multiple subtitle tracks can offer different language options.
- **Accessibility**: Subtitles can also describe non-verbal elements like music or background sounds to aid viewers with hearing difficulties.

## Progress Bar with Milestones: Implementation Explanation
1. **HTML Structure**:  
   - Create a container (`progress-container`) for the progress bar.
   - Add individual markers (milestones) for key sections/modules. Each marker is positioned at a specific percentage along the bar to represent a major checkpoint.
2. **CSS Styling**:  
   - Style the container to resemble a horizontal progress bar with a background color indicating uncompleted progress.
   - Apply a different color to the completed portion of the bar, adjusting its width dynamically.
   - Position milestone markers along the progress bar to show key progress points (e.g., Module 1, Module 2), providing visual cues for completion stages.
3. **JavaScript for Dynamic Updates**:  
   - Create a function to dynamically adjust the width of the filled portion of the bar based on the completion percentage (e.g., 50%).
   - When called, this function updates the bar in real time, reflecting course progress visually.

## Implementing Certificate Generation in a Java Web Application
  1. **Design the Certificate Template**

  2. **Use a PDF Library**
     - Choose a library like **iText** or **Apache PDFBox** to generate PDFs in Java.
     - These libraries allow you to customize text, images, and layout in the certificate PDF.
  3. **Create a Certificate Generator Class**
     - Write a Java class to fill in placeholders in the template with user-specific data, generating a personalized PDF.
  4. **Integrate Certificate Generation in the Web Application**
     - Trigger certificate generation upon course completion or similar events.
     - Call the certificate generator class to create the PDF with the user’s details.
  5. **Provide a Download Option**
     - Implement a servlet or controller to serve the generated PDF as a downloadable file for users.
  6. **Store Certificate Metadata** *(Optional)*
     - Store information about each generated certificate (e.g., certificate ID, generation date) in a database to allow future access and verification.

## Setting Up MySQL Database for a Java Web Application
