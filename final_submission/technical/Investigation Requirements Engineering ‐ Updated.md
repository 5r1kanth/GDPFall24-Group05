# What is Requirements Engineering?

Requirements engineering is a part of systems engineering focused on developing and checking system requirements to ensure they meet the customer's needs. The process starts with gathering and organizing requirements, then validating and verifying them.

Requirements can come from various sources like customers, environmental factors, other systems, company needs, safety concerns, and regulations. Requirements are organized into different levels based on how detailed they need to be and who they affect. At the top level, requirements outline the overall mission agreed upon with the customer. The next levels break down these requirements into specific parts and detailed components. Lower-level requirements are created by further detailing and breaking down the higher-level ones. [1]

## In an Agile/Iterative Software Development Setting

In agile or iterative software development, you go through the requirements engineering process several times. Agile focuses on continuous development and regular updates based on feedback. This means requirements are regularly reviewed and adjusted as the project progresses. [2]

## Project Artifacts from Requirements Engineering

Project artifacts from requirements engineering include:
- UML diagrams (use case, sequence, interaction, class) for modeling
- System requirements documents
- Design papers
- Use cases
- Business process diagrams

Important planning documents are:
- Project plans
- Vision statements
- Roadmaps
- Change logs

Also crucial are:
- Risk assessments
- Standards
- Benchmarks
- Quality plans [3]

## Requirements Elicitation

Requirements elicitation is the process of discovering what stakeholders need from a system by talking to them and gathering their input to ensure the system meets their needs. [3]

## Sequence of Steps in Requirements Elicitation

The steps in requirements elicitation are:
1. Identifying stakeholders
2. Understanding the project
3. Gathering information through interviews
4. Analyzing and documenting requirements
5. Prioritizing needs
6. Checking that the information is correct

The hardest part is usually sorting out conflicting needs from different stakeholders and ensuring that no important details are missed. [3]

## Different Requirements Engineering Activities

Requirements engineering involves several main activities:
- **Elicitation**: Gathering requirements
- **Analysis**: Understanding and improving them
- **Specification**: Writing them down
- **Verification**: Checking for accuracy
- **Validation**: Ensuring they meet needs

The people involved in these activities include stakeholders, users, business analysts, system architects, developers, and quality testers, depending on the task. [4]

## Participants in Requirements Engineering Activities

- **Project Manager**: Oversees the project, ensuring it stays on schedule and within budget while managing resources and stakeholder communication.

- **Technical Lead/Developer**: Guides the development team, makes architectural decisions, mentors members, and participates in coding and feature implementation.

- **Quality Analyst**: Ensures software quality by designing test plans, identifying defects, and collaborating with developers to resolve issues.

- **Business Analyst**: Gathers and analyzes requirements, translating business needs into technical specifications and facilitating communication between teams.

- **System Architect**: Designs system architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability, overseeing technical implementation to meet requirements.

- **Client/Advisor/User**: Represents client interests, providing input on requirements and feedback to ensure the final product meets expectations.[4]

## Team Roles

- **Sai Charan Reddy Suravarapu** - Project Manager
- **Srikanth Pamulapati** – Technical Lead/Developer
- **Bharath Simha Reddy Kothapeta** – Quality Analyst
- **Viplav Billa** - Business Analyst
- **Priyanka Bolem** - System Architect
- **Mark Chai** - Client/Advisor/User

## Functional Requirement

Functional requirements are product functions that developers must implement to enable users to accomplish their tasks. They describe the core features and functions of a system and should focus on actual operations and patterns of the system. They outline the specific features or actions the system should have and need to be clearly understood by both developers and stakeholders. It specifies the tasks that the system should accomplish including how it should interact with users and other systems. Functional requirements are crucial for the development because it ensures that the system delivers the outcome desired by the stakeholders. [5]

## Non-Functional Requirement

Non-functional requirements describe the qualities of the system that define how well it operates its functions rather than the functional behavior, such as its performance, usability, and reliability. They focus on the overall quality and user experience rather than specific functionalities. Non-functional requirements ensure that the system performs efficiently and securely, providing a high-quality user experience. These requirements are important to maintain system stability, user satisfaction, and long-term scalability. [5]

## Key Things to Identify When Working with the Client

When working with a client, find out:
- Their main project goals
- Needed features
- Any constraints like budget or time
- What’s most important to include
- Understand their current issues
- Clarify how they will judge if the project is successful [6]

## Questions to Ask the Client

1. What attracted them to your product, their selection criteria, and their goals.
2. What are their main priorities, growth plans, and approval process.
3. What prevents them from achieving growth, what they want or don't want in a solution, and what they dislike about their current situation.
4. Their expectations, concerns, and customer service standards.
5. Their budget and start date.
6. The competitive landscape and their unique aspects.
7. How they make decisions and approve work. [6]
