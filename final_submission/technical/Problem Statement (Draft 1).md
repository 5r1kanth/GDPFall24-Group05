### **Problem Statement - Online Learning Platform**

**Challenge:** Users of the online learning platform have trouble managing their learning experience because the system is not well-organized or personalized. Although the platform offers various courses, video lectures, quizzes, and certificates, it lacks features that make learning easier and more effective.

Currently, users must go through multiple disconnected sections to access course materials, track their progress, and get feedback. This disorganization makes learning harder and less engaging. Without a simple and unified interface, users may find it difficult to locate relevant resources, leading to frustration and less motivation to complete their courses.

The system also has problems with assessments and feedback. Users often experience delays in getting quiz results and performance feedback, which makes it hard to understand their strengths and areas for improvement quickly. This can slow down the learning process and make it harder to master important concepts.

Furthermore, the platform’s notification system is not effective, causing users to miss updates on new courses, deadlines, and important announcements. Without timely reminders, users may overlook key aspects of their learning, leading to missed opportunities and incomplete goals.

Finally, the lack of personalized learning paths and course recommendations makes it hard for users to find courses that fit their personal goals and career plans. This results in a less focused and less effective learning experience.

# Problem Description: 
A big problem with existing platform is that it doesn’t adjust to each learner's needs. It often provides the same material to everyone, which can be too easy or too hard depending on the learner's background and learning style. This one-size-fits-all approach can make learning frustrating and less effective. Improving the platform by customizing content based on each learner’s progress and offering various types of instruction could make learning more engaging and successful.
